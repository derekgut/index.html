				getting your work done. Self Control lets you put any website or app on your computer on lock, you won't be able to get into the app.

				of the app. If you find yourself getting distracted then this is perfect for you.

				copy and paste the meeting information but it takes a lot of extra work and frustration if  doesnt work. The best option is to just download
				the Zoom app. <a href=" https://zoom.us/download " target="_blank"> Go and download Zoom now </a> </center>
