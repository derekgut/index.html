				<li> When you are in class or doing homework/classwork you should be in a quite place in your house. When deciding where your setup
				should be, find a place where there is little noise throughout the day, with little amounts of people walking by or near you. It should also be  
				comfortable to you, acouple examples are your desk in your room, basment, office, or empty guest room. Having a quite room to work in  
				with little distractions will cause you to pay more attention and make it easier to learn and get your work done. </li> 
				
				<hr> 
				
				<li> 
				Each day you should have 3 to 5 goals you have. If you have 3-5 goals you want to accomplish and hold your self accountable then getting 
				things done will become so much easier. Once you set a goal with things you need to get done that day you focus more. You dont get as distracted
				you will put more importance on thoes goals instead of doing things that dont have anything to do with your goal. If you create golas with your
				school work then you will finish your notes, study, or start a project that you need to get done. And not get as distracted with your phone or video games the school 
				work will not pile on. 
				</li> 
				<hr>
				
				<li> Being flexable is very important with online school/classes, because everthing is online anything can happen. You might not be 
					able to submit your assnisentmt, log into class, or constantly get kicked out for no reason. Being flexable and patient is going to
					be important. You wont get upset and do something that you might reget or ignore and not pay attention the rest of the class casue your 
					upset. If you realize its online technical difficulties happen and accept that, you'll get things done quicker and better. 
					
					
				</li> 	
				
				<hr> 
				
				
				<li> Something that is very important that you should get in the habbit of doing is removing all distraction that would make you 
					procrastinate. Examples of this is removing your phone, ipad, gaming consoles, and tvs from the areo you work. Removing these 
					things from your work area will make you focus on your work, help you not make mistakes, and help you get your work done. When you do 
					this you will notice you will get your work done faster and have more spare time through your day becasue of it. 
				</li> 
				
				<hr> 
				
				<li> One thing you need to do is actively participate during your classes. If you participate will be more engaged and learn more.
					WHen you arent particpating you arent as engaded and learneing as much as you would if you were raising your hand or asking
					questions. Just raise your hand and answer/ask questions you will learn a lot more. 
					
					
				</li> 
			
			<hr> 
			
				<li> Yes, you have to get your work done thats one of the most important thing in online school but just as important is that you 
					take breaks periodically. After starting at the computer screen for an hour or more your brain gets drained, every 30 minutes
					you should step away walk around the house, talk to someone, or do something eles. This rejuvenates your brain and will get you 
					focused to contuie to work. BUt DO NOT go onto soclia media or on your phone you will waste a lot of time scrolling and you wont even notice. 
				
			
				</li> 
				
			<hr> 	
				
				<li> Another good idea is to make studying enjoyable, we all know studying can be a pain and borring but if you make it enjoyable
					by playing games, studying with you friends or going on quizlet. If you make studiyng enjoyable then you will want to study for 
					longer and retain more information. 
					
						
					
				</li> 
				
				
			<hr> 	
				
				<li> WHen you try and crate your schedual look at the most important things you have to do and build around that. For example if you
					
				need to go to the doctors, answer emais, and workout then you should build your day around that. After you know what you have to get done
				for the next day, hold yourself accountable. Thats one of the most important things you can do, hold yourself accountable for getting 
					those things done if you dont then a scheduale is no help. another thing you can do if you can is to get your work done early as 
					soon as posible. Early in the moring you are less likly to procrastinate.
