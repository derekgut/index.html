				<li> A good way to be able to get your work done is to setup a rutine. Get up around the same time and get ready the same way. 
				Then go to class and set up a rutine after class to maximize your time. You dont have to do your school work right after school ends
				if you dont have time but set a time range to get it done. This will create repetion and will make getting your work done so much easier. </li>

				<li> 
					At the end of each week you should refelct on how productive you were. You can do this by writing a couple of notes on your 
					phone or on a piece of paper. Looking back and seeing if you were producitve and getting your work done is important. It shows 
					you if you are getting distracted or arent in a great enviorment for learning. 
				</li>

				<li> Getting organized is a great way to stay ontop of your work and get ahaed of everything. If your files and documents arent 
				     organized it can be easy to loose them and then fall behind on your work. Imagiane you just finished your paper due the next day 
					and wait to submitt it once you go to submitt it the next day you cant find it. You look and look but cant find it and have to 
					start it over again. Thats horrible, being organized and knowing where your paprers and work are is important to relaive stress 
					and anxiety.

				<li> If you have a test coming up with in 2 weeks the best thing you can do is to study. And not not cram study, study a little everyday 
					untill the test day. This is much better the cram studing, when you try and learn everything in one night you will not learn everything.
					You will forget things, but when you study a little everyday you will retain more information and end up doing better on the test. 
					
					
				</li>

				<li>  Being productive everyday and getting your work done is key so you dont fall behind on work. Each week on monday you should 
					write out a schedule and plan out what you have to get done that day and what you want to accomplish that week. If you hold 
					yourself accountable and get done what you need to, you wont fall behind on work and will do better on thoes assignments.

				<li> With online school it is so easy to get distracted, even if you think you are paying attention you might not be. YOu need to be 
					mentally engaded, when you are mentally engaded you will learn more and better understand the topic you are studying. 
					Even though you are taking notes and doing the practice probleems you might be just going through the motions. It is important to 
					be thinking about about what your doing. When you are engaded you will see that you will learn so much more. To get or keep engaged
					you can ask questions, put all distractions in a separte room, and raise your hand. 
					
					
					
					
				</li>

				<li> One great tip is to get the work done done as soon as posible, if you get the work done as sonn as posible then you will do 
					better on the work assigned. If you wait last minute your not going to take your time and get it right. Getting it done before the deadlines
					will create less stress becasue you dont have to worry about getting it done. This is probally one of the most important things 
					for you to do, just get the work done, if you dont and fall behing its going to be hard to catch up. Just get the work done!!
					
					
					
				</li> 
				
				<hr> 
				
			<li> WHen you try and crate your schedual look at the most important things you have to do and build around that. For example if you
					
				need to go to the doctors, answer emais, and workout then you should build your day around that. After you know what you have to get done
				for the next day, hold yourself accountable. Thats one of the most important things you can do, hold yourself accountable for getting 
					those things done if you dont then a scheduale is no help. another thing you can do if you can is to get your work done early as 
					soon as posible. Early in the moring you are less likly to procrastinate.
