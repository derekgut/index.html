				<li> A good way to be able to get your work done is to setup a rutine. Get up around the same time and get ready the same way. 
				Then go to class and set up a rutine after class to maximize your time. You dont have to do your school work right after school ends
				if you dont have time but set a time range to get it done. This will create repetion and will make getting your work done so much easier. </li> 
				
				<li> 
					At the end of each week you should refelct on how productive you were. You can do this by writing a couple of notes on your 
					phone or on a piece of paper. Looking back and seeing if you were producitve and getting your work done is important. It shows 
					you if you are getting distracted or arent in a great enviorment for learning.
